  # Update a 3DSecure or UnionPay payment and continue processing.
  # Use this to handle a 3DSecure redirect response or UnionPay authentication, updating the transaction and continuing processing.
  # @param content_type content type
  # @param client_request_id A client-generated ID for request tracking and signature creation, unique per request.  This is also used for idempotency control. We recommend 128-bit UUID format.
  # @param api_key 
  # @param timestamp Epoch timestamp in milliseconds in the request from a client system. Used for Message Signature generation and time limit (5 mins).
  # @param transaction_id Gateway transaction identifier as returned in the parameter ipgTransactionId
  # @param authentication_response_verification_request 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :message_signature Used to ensure the request has not been tampered with during transmission. The Message-Signature is the Base64 encoded HMAC hash (SHA256  algorithm with the API Secret as the key.) For more information, refer to the supporting documentation on the Developer Portal.
