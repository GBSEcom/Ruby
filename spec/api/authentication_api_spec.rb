  # unit tests for authentication_access_tokens_post
  # Generate an access token for user authentication.
  # This is the access token generation call for authorizing subsequent financial transactions. A valid access token is required for web client requests.
  # @param content_type Content type.
  # @param client_request_id A client-generated ID for request tracking and signature creation, unique per request.  This is also used for idempotency control. We recommend 128-bit UUID format.
  # @param api_key Key given to merchant after boarding associating their requests with the appropriate app in Apigee.
  # @param timestamp Epoch timestamp in milliseconds in the request from a client system. Used for Message Signature generation and time limit (5 mins).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :message_signature Used to ensure the request has not been tampered with during transmission. The Message-Signature is the Base64 encoded HMAC hash (SHA256 algorithm with the API Secret as the key.) For more information, refer to the supporting documentation on the Developer Portal.
