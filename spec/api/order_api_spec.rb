  # unit tests for order_inquiry
  # Retrieve the state of an order.
  # Use this query to get the current state of an existing order.
  # @param content_type Content type.
  # @param client_request_id A client-generated ID for request tracking and signature creation, unique per request.  This is also used for idempotency control. We recommend 128-bit UUID format.
  # @param api_key Key given to merchant after boarding associating their requests with the appropriate app in Apigee.
  # @param timestamp Epoch timestamp in milliseconds in the request from a client system. Used for Message Signature generation and time limit (5 mins).
  # @param order_id Gateway order identifier as returned in the parameter orderId.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :message_signature Used to ensure the request has not been tampered with during transmission. The Message-Signature is the Base64 encoded HMAC hash (SHA256 algorithm with the API Secret as the key.) For more information, refer to the supporting documentation on the Developer Portal.
  # @option opts [String] :region Indicates the region where the client wants the transaction to be processed. This will override the default processing region identified for the client. Available options are argentina, brazil, germany, india and northamerica. Region specific store setup and APIGEE boarding is required in order to use an alternate region for processing.
  # @option opts [String] :store_id An optional outlet ID for clients that support multiple stores in the same developer app.
  # @return [OrderResponse]

  # unit tests for submit_secondary_transaction_from_order
  # Perform return or postAuth secondary transactions.
  # Use this to perform a postAuth or return secondary transaction using order ID. Partial postAuths and returns are allowed.
  # @param content_type Content type.
  # @param client_request_id A client-generated ID for request tracking and signature creation, unique per request.  This is also used for idempotency control. We recommend 128-bit UUID format.

  # @param timestamp Epoch timestamp in milliseconds in the request from a client system. Used for Message Signature generation and time limit (5 mins).
  # @param order_id Gateway order identifier as returned in the parameter orderId.
  # @param secondary_transaction Accepted request types: PostAuthTransaction, VoidTransaction, VoidPreAuthTransactions, ReturnTransaction, AchPostAuthTransaction, AchVoidTransaction, AchReturnTransaction and PreAuthSecondaryTransaction.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :message_signature Used to ensure the request has not been tampered with during transmission. The Message-Signature is the Base64 encoded HMAC hash (SHA256 algorithm with the API Secret as the key.) For more information, refer to the supporting documentation on the Developer Portal.
